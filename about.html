        <p>I am a software developer with proficiency in Ruby on Rails, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Heroku, AWS, Azure, and many other related technologies.</p>
        <p>Additional familiarity with cyber security, data analytics and blockchain development. </p>
        <p>After High School I went to Pepperdine University in Malibu California on a music sholarship for classical piano performance.</p>
        <p>One year in I decided this was not what I wanted to do and left to pursue music outside of school, I have subsequently toured the world and released many albums.</p>
        <p>I began working in the auction industry around 2009 where I initially handled logistics and later became a property specialist, primarily for furniture and decorative arts and later further specializing in musical instruments.</p>
        <p>In more recent years I personally handled many large estates of famous musicians such as Walter Becker, Ronnie James Dio, Greg Lake, and Keith Emmerson.</p>
        <p>I had been contemplating a transition into tech for some time and in 2020 began the journey in earnest. I completed a cyber security bootcamp at UCLA extension with much success but immediately knew I wanted to further my knowledge and began learning fullstack development in addition to general computer science.</p>
